# mdb-docs-and-content
The following repository contains content of the mdbootstrap.com website, especially documentation. 

Within the root folder you can find two main languages - English and Chineese (simplified) (to be translated). 

Next level defines technology (jQuery, Angular, React and Vue). 3rd level defines platform - web or mobile (note: currently MDB is available as a web development framework, we are builing a Native version of MDB dedicated to mobile apps). 

4th defines documenation type (documentation/tutorial etc.), currently only docs are available at GitHub. In a future we will move also other content.

Finally 5th and 6th level defines categories and specific components. Please note that the folder structure corresponds with URL i.e.:

https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/css/text-color/

Can be found under /en/jquery/web/docs/css/text-color/ (https://github.com/mdbootstrap/mdb-docs-and-content/tree/master/en/jquery/web/docs/css/text-color )

Each folder contains multiple files: 
- o.html  (Content of the overview TAB)  
- o-ss.html (Content of the scrollspy for Overview TAB)  
- gs.html (Content of the Getting started TAB)  
- gs-ss.html (Content of the scrollspy for Getting started TAB)
