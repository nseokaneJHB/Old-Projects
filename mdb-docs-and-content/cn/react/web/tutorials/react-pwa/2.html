    <strong>Deploying to Firebase</strong>
  </h2>

  <p class="description">
    At this point, we have a small, good-looking application. But to be honest - it is not very useful. It's just a
    frontend - we are not able to store new appointments and new data won't persist if you refresh the page. The app is
    also available only on our local environment.</p>

  <p class="description">Certainly, we need some backend solution, but on the other hand we are here to learn about PWA
    concepts, not to bother about servers, API or datastores.</p>

  <p class="description">In this tutorial, we are going to use a firebase platform, a solution provided by Google. It
    allows us to keep our backend code as simple as possible
    and focus on what really matters in building progressive web apps.</p>

  <p class="description">In order to take advantage of the benefits provided by Firebase - we need to set up a new
    project there. To do this, open the following <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">address</a>
    in your web browser.</p>

  <div class="text-center"> <img class="img-fluid" src="https://mdbootstrap.com/wp-content/themes/mdbootstrap4/content/react/tutorials/react-pwa/2/firebase.png"
      alt="Firebase console"><br></div>


  <p>After logging in to the Firebase service, you need to create a new application. To do this, click the "Add
    Project" button and go through the short form in which you will provide the name of your project and some other
    required information.</p>


  <p>Now, we need to install firebase-tools globally on our machine to be able to use firebase commands. Open the
    command-line/ terminal and type:</p>

  <mdbsnippet>
    <code data-lang="js" data-name="CLI">
      npm install -g firebase-tools
    </code>
  </mdbsnippet>

  <p>After that, let's sign in to the Firebase service using the login and password of the Google account:</p>

  <mdbsnippet>
    <code data-lang="js" data-name="CLI">
      firebase login
    </code>
  </mdbsnippet>

  <p>Next, we need to initialize our app as a Firebase project. In the project root directory run:</p>

  <mdbsnippet>
    <code data-lang="js" data-name="CLI">
      firebase init
    </code>
  </mdbsnippet>

  <div class="text-center"> <img class="img-fluid my-2" src="https://mdbootstrap.com/wp-content/themes/mdbootstrap4/content/react/tutorials/react-pwa/2/console.png"
      alt="Firebase CLI"><br></div>

  <p>The console will ask you a few questions - answer them according to the guide below:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><i>Which Firebase CLI features do you want to setup for this folder?</i> For now, select just firebase hosting.
      We will configure other features latter.</li>
    <li><i>Select a default Firebase project for this directory</i> Choose the project you have just created on the
      Firebase platform</li>
    <li><i>What do you want to use as your public directory?</i> - <code>build</code> - it's where our production code
      lives</li>
    <li><i>Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? (y/N)</i> - <code>y</code></li>
    <li><i>File build/index.html already exists. Overwrite? (y/N)</i> - <code>n</code></li>
  </ul>


  <p>Firebase will create two files with configuration and project information. <code>firebase.json</code> and <code>.firebaserc</code>.
    If you want to change any settings you defined during the initialization process, check them out.</p>

  <p>Before we deploy our application to the firebase servers, we will prepare an npm script which will save us some
    keystrokes in the future. Add following npm script in your package.json file:
  </p>

  <mdbsnippet>
    <code data-lang="js" data-name="package.json">
      ...
      "scripts": {
        "deploy": "npm run build && firebase deploy",
        ...
    </code>
  </mdbsnippet>


  <p>From now on, if we want to deploy a new version of our application, we just need to run this script.</p>

  <p>It fires the build process which prepares a production version of our application and then sends it to the
    Firebase Hosting service. Now, we have nothing else left to do but to publish our app. </p>

  <mdbsnippet>
    <code data-lang="js" data-name="CLI">
        npm run deploy
      </code>
  </mdbsnippet>

  <p>And that's it! Your first application is already on the Firebase servers, so you can pick up your mobile phone and
    open your favorite web browser at the address of the application!</p>
