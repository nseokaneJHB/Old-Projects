    <p class="description">
      In this tutorial, I wanted to show what a Progressive Web Application really is. The topic is so broad that it
      cannot be described in one article. The application itself â€” its functionality and appearance may not be impressive,
      but in my opinion, it is a good example for the beginning of your adventure with PWA. Thanks to that, you
      have
      at least a basic knowledge of how to build a PWA application and what it is related to.
