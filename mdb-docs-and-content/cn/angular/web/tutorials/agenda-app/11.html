<h2>Summary</h2>

  <div>Our app is done, however there are still a few more things which we should do:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      change the type of any event properties (i.e. switch time to JS Date instead of string)
    </li>
    <li>
      call an external API to get a real weather forecast
    </li>
    <li>
      add validation to our form (make sure that the user fills in all of the mandatory data)
    </li>
    <li>
      handle duplicates
    </li>
  </ul>
 <p>and a few more interesting things. We will learn all about that in Part 2 of our tutorial.Â </p>

<p>Before we move to next part of building our app let's learn some basics and concepts of Angular and TypeScript. Next 2 chapters are dedicated to it, after them we will get back to enhancing our application.</p>

<p>I also strongly recommend to check our PWA tutorial for Angular, however keep in mind that it dedicated to users with basic knowldege of Angular.</p>
