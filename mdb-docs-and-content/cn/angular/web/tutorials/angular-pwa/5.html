      <strong>Building the application logic</strong>
    </h2>

    <p class="description">
      Finally, the time has come for us to take up something more interesting. It's high time that we complement our
      template with the logic that is needed for our PWA to work.
      To do this, copy the following code to the <code>app.component.ts</code> file.
    </p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="js" data-name="TS">
        import { SwUpdate } from '@angular/service-worker';
        import { Component, ViewChild, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
        import { ModalDirective } from 'angular-bootstrap-md';

        @Component({
            selector: 'app-root',
            templateUrl: './app.component.html',
            styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss']
        })
        export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
            @ViewChild('basicModal') basicModal: ModalDirective;

            constructor(private swUpdate: SwUpdate) { }

            ngOnInit() {
                this.checkForUpdates();
            }

            forceUpdate() {
                this.swUpdate.activateUpdate().then(() => {
                document.location.reload();
                });
            }

            checkForUpdates() {
                if (this.swUpdate.isEnabled) {
                    this.swUpdate.available.subscribe(() => {
                    console.log('New Version');
                    this.basicModal.show();
                        });
                    }
                }
            }
      </code>
    </mdbsnippet>

    <p class="description">
      We inject the <code>SwUpdate</code> service into the constructor, which is a Service Worker used for working with
      application
      updates.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      During the <code>ngOnInit</code> lifecycle the <code>checkForUpdates()</code> method is called, whose task is to
      check if a new version of
      the PWA application is available.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      If available, the <code>show()</code> method from the <code>ModalDirective</code> directive is called, which is
      responsible for displaying
      the modal with information that a new version of the application is available.
      <br>
      There are two buttons in this modal. One of them is responsible for calling the <code>forceUpdate()</code>
      method, which
      reloads the application. The second button closes the modal without updating the application.
    </p>

    <p class="description">It's very simple - isn't it? Service Worker checks if there is a new version based on
      the application size. If there is one, the user can either reload the application or work with an older version
      of the application.</p>
