    <strong>Adding the @angular/pwa mechanism to your existing application</strong>
  </h2>

  <p class="description">In Angular 6 we gained a very convenient option, thanks to which we can use one command to
    configure the PWA mechanism in our application. Thanks to that we save ourselves the effort of modifying
    individual project files.
    In order to add PWA to your application, type the following command in the terminal:</p>
  <pre class="code-toolbar">
          <code class="language-javascript">
              ng add @angular/pwa
          </code>
      </pre>

  <p class="description">After performing the above command, some new files have been created in our project and some
    existing ones have been modified.</p>
  <p><strong>New files:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>ngsw-config.json</code> - this contains the Service Workers configuration, thanks to which it is
      possible to cache
      application data in PWA;</li>
    <li><code>manifest.json</code> - in this file you will find the configuration of application's appearance. Here
      you
      can also change the name of the application, change the background and theme color;</li>
    <li>The <code>assets</code> directory has been expanded with icons for different resolutions, so that each type
      of device gets
      a customized icon for it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Modified files</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>app.module.ts</code> - the ServiceWorkerModule module has been added to the main module of our
      application. This allows us to use various functions provided by Service Workers;</li>
    <li><code>angular.json</code> - several options for configuration and operation of PWA have been added to the
      file;</li>
    <li><code>package.json</code> - a new @angular/wa package has been added, which we added in the previous step;</li>
    <li><code>index.html</code> - a link to the manifest.json file was added as well as the theme color - the same as
      defined in
      the manifest.json file.</li>
  </ul>

    <strong>What Service Workers are?</strong>
  </h2>

  <p><strong>Service Workers</strong> is a JavaScript script that does not have direct access to the DOM tree. It is
    run independently
    of the website and allows you to use features that do not require interaction with the user or the website. As of
    today, this is, among other things, push notifications and background synchronization.
  </p>
  <p>In the future it will
    also include geofencing and periodical synchronization. Service Workers are very interesting because they also support
    offline mechanisms, thanks to which the programmer has complete control over the functionality of the
    application.
  </p>
  <p>Service Workers switch off when not used to free up resources, and start up automatically when needed. If you need
    to use some data that will always be the same, use the IndexedDB API.</p>
