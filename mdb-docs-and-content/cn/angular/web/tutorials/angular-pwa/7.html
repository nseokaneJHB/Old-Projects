      <strong>Deploying the application on Firebase</strong>
    </h2>

    <p class="description">The PWA application will only work on a server that is encrypted (HTTPS protocol). The
      quickest way to run a PWA application on a domain that is HTTPS-certified is to deploy applications in Firebase
      Hosting. In order to create a Firebase account, open <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/" target="blank">this
        page</a>.</p>

    <p class="description">After logging in to the Firebase service, you need to create a new application, which will
      be our PWA application. To do this, click the "Add Project" button and go through the short form in which you
      will provide the name of your project and some other required information.</p>

    <p class="description">After creating a new Firebase application, return to your PWA application terminal,
      and install the firebase-tools utility by running the following command in it.</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
            <code class="language-javascript">
              npm install -g firebase-tools
            </code>
        </pre>

    <p class="description">After installing firebase-tools we will have no choice but to then sign in to the Firebase
      service using the login and password of the Google account, initiate a new Firebase project, and deploy it in the
      Firebase Hosting service. To do this, type in the command <code>firebase login</code> in your terminal.</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
            <code class="language-javascript">
              firebase login
            </code>
        </pre>

    <p class="description">After logging in to Firebase, type in the command <code>firebase init hosting</code> to
      initialize the
      project, which will be deposited in Firebase Hosting. Then, from the menu that will appear to you in the
      terminal,
      select the Firebase application created two steps above. Then the console will ask you a few questions - answer
      them according to the diagram below:</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
            <code class="language-javascript">
              firebase init hosting
            </code>
        </pre>
    <ul>
      <li>What do you want to use as your public directory? - <strong>dist</strong></li>
      <li>Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? - <strong>y</strong></li>
      <li>File dist/index.html already exists. Overwrite? - <strong>n</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="description">After initializing the application we have nothing else left to do but to send it to
      the Firebase servers. But first we have to build a production version of our application!
      <br> To do this, run the command below in the terminal of your application.</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
            <code class="language-javascript">
              npm run pwa
            </code>
          </pre>

    <p class="description">The last step after initiating the Firebase application is to deploy it in the Firebase
      Hosting
      service. To do this, type in the command below in the terminal of your PWA application,
      and open the
      browser at the address, that will display the terminal after the deployment process is finished.</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
            <code class="language-javascript">
              firebase deploy
            </code>
          </pre>

    <p class="description">And that's it! Your first PWA application is already on the Firebase servers, so you can
      pick up
      your mobile phone and open your favorite web browser at the address of the application. When you add it to your
      smartphone's home screen, you can launch it at any time - even without an active Internet connection via the
      icon. Isn't this a great option?</p>
