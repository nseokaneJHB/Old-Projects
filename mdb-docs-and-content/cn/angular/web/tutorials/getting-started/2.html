<h2>1. Overview</h2>

  <p>Within the last lesson we went through the most important file within our project. Now we will focus on the components. </p>

<p>Among other advantages, Angular <strong>gained its position thanks to components-based architecture</strong>. </p>

<p>Components can be thought of as <strong>small pieces of an interface that are independent of each other</strong>. Imagine that you have a simple application with a list of items and a corresponding search box to retrieve the items by word matches. The box with listed names, the search box, and the main sheet where the other two boxes are placed <strong>are all considered separate components in Angular</strong>.</p>

<p>Components of a similar nature are <strong>well encapsulated, in other words, self-sufficient</strong>. <strong>Developers can reuse them across different parts of an application.</strong> This is particularly useful in enterprise-scope applications where different systems converge but may have many similar elements like search boxes, date pickers, sorting lists, etc.</p>

<p>Let's have a look how components are build within Angular code </p>

  <img class="img-fluid" src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() ?>/content/angular/tutorials/getting-started/2/file_structure.png" alt="Angule project file strcuture" />

	<p>As you can see within a <code>src/</code> location, there is a folder called <code>app</code> containing a few files starting with <code>app.*</code> name inside. The <code>app</code> represents <strong>App</strong> component. </p> 

	<p> Usually <strong>components are organised within a folders </strong> (1 component = 1 folder). Each Angular project has to contain at least 1 component. Each component consist of few files:</p>



<h2>2. Component logic (<code>.ts</code> file)</h2>

  <p>Let's open file located in <code>/src/app/app.component.ts</code>. You will se the following content  </p>

  <img class="img-fluid" src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() ?>/content/angular/tutorials/getting-started/2/app_component_ts.png" alt="App.component.ts file"/>



	<p>The <code>app.component.ts</code> file consist of few parts:</p>

	<h4>1. Imports</h4>

<p>At the begining of the component's <code>.ts</code> file we have to import a <mark>Component</mark> from the Angular library. This is required to make our component working. Component is a <code>Decorator</code> (don't have to bother what does it mean for now) - it provides a configuration metadata that determines how the component should be processed, initialized and used in a runtime.</p>

<p>Whenever we want to use other components within another component we also have to import it in that place. (we will learn how to do that in a next lesson). </p>

<h4>2. Metadata</h4>

<p>The <code>@Component</code> decorator which we imported in a first line allows us to specify a <code>matadata</code> for our component. The metadata contains few parameters: 

<ul>
	<li>The <code>selector</code> contains the name of the tag that can be used to create this component.</li>
	<li>The <code>templateUrl</code> contains the relative URL/path to the HTML template <code>template</code> (<code>app.component.html</code> file)</li>
	<li>The <code>styleUrls</code> contains the array of CSS styles to be used for styling the component <strong>or</strong> a path to the external file (<code>app.component.scss</code> file)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>You might noticed from a previous lesson, that we have used a <mark>&lt;app-root&gt;&lt;/app-root&gt;</mark> in the <code>index.html</code> file.</p>

<p>Our component can be called in your HTML code just like any standard HTML tag, i.e:</p>

  <img class="img-fluid" src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() ?>/content/angular/tutorials/getting-started/2/selector.png" alt="App-root selector"/>


<h4>3. Class</h4>

<p>The last part of our component is a Component Class which contains atributes and functions. This is the place where entire logic of given component is stored. In a next lesson we will fill this component with some functions to make our application working.  </p>


<h2>3. Component template (<code>.html)</code> file)</h2>

<p>The template file which is responsible for view of our component. A template looks like regular HTML, except that it also contains Angular template syntax. Our template can use <i>data binding</i> which allows us to synchronize data between our Application and DOM. </p>


<h2>4. Component styles  (<code>.scss</code> file)</h2>



<p>This file contains all the styles for our component. </p>

<!-- TODO explain how to style components
 -->
<h2>5. Component tests (<code>.spec.ts</code> file)</h2>

<p>Within this file we will create a tests of our component. Tests are important for each application, using them help us avoid breaking components logic while making some updates/enhances in it.</p>

<h2>6. App.module code (<code>.module.ts</code> file)</code></h2>

<p>As we mentioned before - Angular application <strong>has to contain at least one component</strong>. This first component is called a <strong>root component.</strong>. A root component is the first Angular component that gets bootstrapped when the application runs. Two things are special about this component:</p>

<p>First, if you open the application module file src/app/app.module.ts:</p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() ?>/content/angular/tutorials/getting-started/2/root_component.png" alt="Root component"/>

<p>You'll notice that, it's added to the bootstrap array of the module definition.</p>

<p>Second, if you open the src/index.html file (the first file that gets rendered when you visit the application URL) of the application. You'll notice that, it's called inside the document <body> tag. </p>

 <p class="note note-warning"><strong>Important:</strong><br>
   <code>app.module.ts</code> file is only required for our App component (root component). All other components which we will use inside our application wont require <code>module.ts</code> file to work. </p>
