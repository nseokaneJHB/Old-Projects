  <h2>What is Angular (actually)?</h2>

          <p>Angular is a framework for building client applications in HTML,CSS and JavaScript/TypeScript.</p>

          <p>In fact, <strong>TypeScript</strong> is definitely more common within the Angular environment. Why? I will explain that in further lessons. <strong>If you have never worked with or even heard of TypeScript before? Don't worry! That tutorial is for you</strong>. I will explain to you what it is about using numerous examples and sample codes.</p>

          <h2>Why do we need Angular?</h2>

          <p>Many people ask me - why do we need all these frameworks like Angular, Vue or React (which in fact is not a "framework" but that will be subject of another tutorial). <strong>Isn't old plain JS or jQuery sufficient?</strong></p>

          <p> I always answer <strong>Yes it is.</strong> Technically you can build almost any application using plain JS or libraries like jQuery, however, if you ever attempted to build a more complex application consisting of multiple modules and thousands line of code you probably already know that maintaining that code is a nightmare. Very often our code is not reusable therefore we have to <strong>copy and paste very similar pieces of code multiple times</strong>.</p>

          <p>As our application <strong>gets more complex</strong>, JavaScirpt code is getting <strong>harder to maintain</strong>. We need a way to structure our code. Another important part which we cannot forget is <strong>tests of our application</strong>. As projects get bigger their testing becomes crucial for stability. That's why in recent years frameworks like Vue or Angular have been created — to make developers life easier. </p>

         <h2>Benefits of using Angular:</h2>

        <p>Although summarizing all benefits of using Angular would probably take a few A4 pages, let me provide you a summary of the best features. For now, you have to trust me but once you work through the tutorial, you will quickly agree:</p>

         <ul>
           <li>Increases code reusability</li>
           <li>Provides structure to JavaScript</li>
           <li>Makes an application more testable</li>
           <li>Gives our application a clean structure</li>
           <li>Modular development</li>
           <li>Two-way data-binding</li>
           <li>Great for <strong>SPA</strong> (Single-Page Applications)</li>
         </ul>


<!--          Using jQuery "back in the day" resulted in wild west JavaScript development. Code all over the place...nothing was easy to read, just events and DOM manipulation everywhere. The advantage of these new JavaScript libraries like AngularJs, Aurelia, Ember, and Meteor is that it provides a more "civilized" and structured way of building complete JavaScript applications. ;-)


         Templating
         jQuery does have some templating, but each JavaScript library has that built into it by nature.
         Two-way data-binding
         While you can write a simple two-way data-binding event in jQuery, JavaScript MVC libraries provide a more declarative (using HTML) way of connecting models to your view.
         Great for SPA (Single-Page Applications)
         At one point, I started writing a pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery application for strictly mobile (ASP.NET MVC Optimization Series: Introduction and Setup ). The moral of the story is that libraries like Angular, Aurelia, Ember, and Meteor provide all of the plumbing for you instead of writing all of it in jQuery (which I will be rewriting my optimized HTML app using Aurelia in a future post).
         Modular development
         Angular (and other JavaScript libraries) provide an easier way to load modular pieces of code and views dynamically into your application. Yes, I know there is a $("div").load() in jQuery, but this is code that shouldn't be sprinkled throughout your jQuery application. It should be part of the library. -->
