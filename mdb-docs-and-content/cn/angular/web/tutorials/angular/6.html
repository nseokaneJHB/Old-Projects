  <h2>AngularJS vs Angular2 vs Angular7?</h2>


<p>If you have tried to search for more information about Angular on the web you might notice that it pops up under different names like <code>AngularJS</code>, <code>Angular 2</code> or <code>Angular 7</code>. So what are the differences? </p>



  <h2>AngularJS </h2>

<p>The history of Angular is quite intricate (especially if you consider that there was no Angular 3). <strong>AngularJS was created by Google in 2010</strong> as a JavaScript framework. AngularJS became very powerful and widely used. As a result, the AngularJS team started adding more and more features to it. However, as often happens to many in-house solutions, <strong>AngularJS was missing some fundamentals</strong> and wasn't designed to meet everyday applications needs. </p>


  <h2>Angular 2</h2>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() ?>/content/angular/tutorials/angular/6/img/02.png" alt="Angular2">


  <p> As the project was growing it was also getting more and more complex so the Angular team decided to rewrite it using TypeScript and that's how <strong>Angular 2 came into existence in 2016</strong>. You can (and should) think of Angular 2 as a <strong>totally different framework</strong>. It's not backward compatible. 

<p>Soon after releasing Angular 2, the core team has announced something which surprised a lot of developers — Angular 4. </p>


  <h2>Angular 4</h2>

<p> Probably many developers including myself shared the same thought — did I miss something? Is Angular launching yet another new, not compatible framework? Luckily no :). </p>

<p>Due to fact that Angular consist of different modules </p>

<pre class="code-toolbar"><code class="language-typescript">@angular/core 2.3.0
@angular/compiler 2.3.0
@angular/http 2.3.0
@angular/router 3.3.0
</code></pre>

<p>As you noticed, all the version were same except for router. To align all the versions, the Angular team decided to jump directly into version 4. In fact, it's not even a big upgrade. Furthermore 
Angular is on an aggressive schedule. They released Angular 5 on November, 1st 2017. Angular 6 on May 3 2018, Angular 7 on October 2018 and Angular 8 is expected in May 2010 while Angular 9 in October/November 2019. </p>



  <blockquote class="blockquote bq-danger">
    <p class="bq-title">Remember!</p>
    <p>The Angular team decided to drop the version suffix <strong>so there is no Angular 2 or Angular 7</strong>. There is just <strong>Angular and a specific release</strong>. Therefore keep in mind that whenever you will look for any resources regarding Angular on the net, <strong>AngularJS is totally different from Angular X, but Angular 2,4,5,6,7,8,9 are just newer versions of the same framework</strong> and very often compatible with each other (So if you find some solution utilizing Angular 4, there is high probability that it will also work for Angular 5). </p>
