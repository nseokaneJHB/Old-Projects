      <strong>Making an app installable - manifest.json</strong>
    </h2>

    <p class="description">
      One of the most powerful functions that PWA offers is the ability to add our web app to a device's home screen.
      This single feature fills the big gap between native and web apps - from now on our web apps can look and feel
      like regular native apps.
    </p>

    <p class="description">Surprisingly, <strong>it doesn't require a lot of work</strong>. We will cover everything in
      upcoming lessons.</p>

    <p class="description">If you look through <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/
      ">the
        official documentation</a>, you find out that there are only a few requirements, which have to be met:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The web app is not already installed</li>
      <li>the user has interacted with the domain for at least 30 seconds</li>
      <li>codebase includes a web app manifest</li>
      <li>App is served over HTTPS</li>
      <li>Has registered a service worker with a fetch event handler</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Of course the two first are beyond our control. As a developer, you have to take care of the last three ones.
      Let's begin with the app manifest.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong> What is an app manifest?</strong></h4>

    <p>App manifest is a simple JSON file. If you have previously worked with <code>create-react-app</code> boilerplate
      you probably stumbled upon this file while browsing through project directories. By default, it is placed in the
      public directory. Let's open our project and check what is inside.</p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="js" data-name="public/manifest.json">
          {
            "short_name": "React App",
            "name": "Create React App Sample",
            "icons": [
              {
                "src": "favicon.ico",
                "sizes": "64x64 32x32 24x24 16x16",
                "type": "image/x-icon"
              }
            ],
            "start_url": "./index.html",
            "display": "standalone",
            "theme_color": "#000000",
            "background_color": "#ffffff"
          }
        </code>
    </mdbsnippet>

    <p>As you can see, it's a simple JSON object with a key-value pairs which describes our application. It resembles
      an App Store description of a native app. There are a lot of supported properties which you can use there. A full
      list can be found <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Most of the key names are self-explanatory.
      <ul>
        <li><code>name</code> and <code>short_name</code> - simple! Short name will be displayed as a label for an icon
          on the device home screen.</li>
        <li><code>icons</code> - is just an array of icons to use. We will use a set of icons of varying sizes to make
          sure that it will look good on every device.</li>
        <li><code>start_url</code> - defines the URL that loads when a user launches the application. It might also be
          a good idea to use it for analytics purposes, for example by defining UTM</li>
      </ul>

      <mdbsnippet>
        <code data-lang="js" data-name="public/manifest.json">
            "start_url": "/?utm_source=homescreen",
          </code>
      </mdbsnippet>

      <ul>
        <li><code>display</code> - I chose thr standalone option to mimic a native app look.</li>
        <li><code>background_color</code> - lets us define the background color of the splash screen.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Let's adjust the file already provided by the create-react-app boilerplate to our needs:</p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="js" data-name="public/manifest.json">
          {
            "short_name": "Agenda App",
            "name": "Daily Agenda Progressive Web App",
            "icons": [
              {
                "src": "icons/icon-72x72.png",
                "sizes": "72x72",
                "type": "image/png"
              },
              {
                "src": "icons/icon-96x96.png",
                "sizes": "96x96",
                "type": "image/png"
              },
              {
                "src": "icons/icon-128x128.png",
                "sizes": "128x128",
                "type": "image/png"
              },
              {
                "src": "icons/icon-144x144.png",
                "sizes": "144x144",
                "type": "image/png"
              },
              {
                "src": "icons/icon-152x152.png",
                "sizes": "152x152",
                "type": "image/png"
              },
              {
                "src": "icons/icon-192x192.png",
                "sizes": "192x192",
                "type": "image/png"
              },
              {
                "src": "icons/icon-384x384.png",
                "sizes": "384x384",
                "type": "image/png"
              },
              {
                "src": "icons/icon-512x512.png",
                "sizes": "512x512",
                "type": "image/png"
              }
            ],
            "start_url": "./index.html",
            "display": "standalone",
            "theme_color": "#2EA6E7",
            "background_color": "#2EA6E7"
          }

        </code>
    </mdbsnippet>

    <p> And that's it, out basic app manifest is ready. In the next lesson, we will take care of the two other points
      on our criteria list - HTTPS and service worker.</p>
