    <h1 class="main-title">React Progressive Web App Tutorial</h1>

    <!--Description-->
    <p class="description">
      Recently, Google, one of the biggest proponents of PWA, released Chrome 72 for Android, which supports the
      long-awaited TWA (Trusted Web Activity) API. It means that from now on, PWA can be distributed via the Google
      Play Store.
    </p>

    <p class="description">Thanks to Googleâ€™s strong advocacy of PWA, it is safe to say that PWA is the future of web
      applications. In this tutorial series, we are going to explain the core concepts involved in creating PWA Apps
      with React.</p>

    <p>This tutorial requires basic knowledge of React. If you are new to React, please check out our tutorial</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong>Is this tutorial really free?</strong></h4>

    <p>Yes, it's completely free.</p>


    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong>What will I build?</strong></h4>
    <p>
      In this tutorial, we will transform our Agenda App, which we created from scratch in our basic tutorial into a
      Progressive Web App. Lesson after lesson, we are going to add new functionalities - in fact, this is the essence
      of PWA - <strong>we aim to enhance user's experience progressively</strong>. You will be able to successfully
      apply all the techniques we are going to learn to in your own project. In fact any web app or website can be
      converted into PWA, so I encourage you to use what you will learn with your React Appa, trust me, this will be a
      fun challenge!
