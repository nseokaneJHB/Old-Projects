      <strong>PWA audit</strong>
    </h2>

    <p>How can we tell if our app is working as a progressive web app? Is there something we can improve on? Or our app
      is already good enough?</p>

    <p>In today's article, we are going to learn about an auditing tool which helps us determine if our app qualifies
      as a PWA.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong>Lighthouse</strong> </h4>

    <p>Lighthouse is an open source tool introduced by Google. At first, it was created to measure the performance of
      PWA, but now it's functionality covers much more. It verifies the quality of your application in five categories:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Performance</li>
      <li>Progressive Web App</li>
      <li>Accessibility</li>
      <li>Best Practices</li>
      <li>SEO</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the report, you will get a score between 0 and 100 points, where 100 is the highest. What's interesting -
      your score may vary between tests - it may happen because of changing network conditions, different adds or
      processes running in the background on your computer. It is worth to run a few tests and take the average of the
      results. </p>

    <p>Moreover, it gives you a set of recommendations - that, when implemented, improve your website performance and
      visibility to the search engines. It's always a good idea to measure your site against Google's set of criteria -
      their suggestions will help you to become a better developer.</p>

    <p>Lighthouse is available as a Chrome extension for Chrome 52 and later</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5"><strong>How to run the audit?</strong> </h4>

    <p>To run the audit open your app in the Chrome browser. Auditing tools can be found in the Audits tab.</p>

    <div class="text-center"> <img class="img-fluid" src="https://mdbootstrap.com/wp-content/themes/mdbootstrap4/content/react/tutorials/react-pwa/8/audit.png"
        alt="Lighthouse audit"></div>

    <p>Open the tab, adjust the settings to your needs or run as a default. After a brief moment, you will see a
      report.</p>

        alt="Lighthouse report"></div>


    <p> As you can see, according to Google's guidelines, our app is fully progressive. Not bad at all. Of course there
      is room for improvement in case of other criteria - I encourage you to investigate and try to solve those issues
      as it could be a fun challenge.</p>
