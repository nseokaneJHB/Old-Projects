<h2>Summary</h2>

  <div>Our app is done, however there are still a few more things which we should do:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      change the type of any event properties (i.e. switch time to JS Date instead of string)
    </li>
    <li>
      call an external API to get a real weather forecast
    </li>
    <li>
      add validation to our form (make sure that the user fills in all of the mandatory data)
    </li>
    <li>
      handle duplicates
    </li>
  </ul>
 <p>and a few more interesting things. We will learn all about that in Part 2 of our tutorial.Â </p>
