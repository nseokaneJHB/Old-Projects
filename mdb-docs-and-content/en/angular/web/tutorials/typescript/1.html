  <h2>Fundamentals</h2>


  <p>In order to crate Angular apps, you have to know Typescript. Within thenext few lessons I will teach you its basic concepts, by covering the following subjects: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Type annotations</li>
  <li>Arrow functions</li>
  <li>Interfaces</li>
  <li>Classes</li>
  <li>Constructors</li>
  <li>Access modifiers</li>
  <li>Properties</li>
  <li>Modules</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are familiar with these concepts you can skip this tutorial and navigate to the next part, however if you are new to TypeScript then follow it carefully.</p>

<h3>What is TypeScript?</h3>

<p>At a first glance you might confuse TypeScript with JavaScript. Especially that any valid JavaScript code is also a valid TypeScript code, however, it doesn't work another way around. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. </p>

<blockquote class="blockquote bq-primary">
    <p class="bq-title">Remember:</p>
    <p><strong>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript</strong></p>
</blockquote>


<p>That means that <strong>TypeScript extends JavaScript with extra functionality</strong> which is not present in the current version of JavaScript supported by most browsers. So what are those features? </p>

<h4>Strong typing</h4>
  <p>If you are familiar with languages like Java or C# you probably know that <strong>each variable requires a type and this type has to be declared upfront</strong>. JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamically typed language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types:</p>

  <pre class="code-toolbar"><code class="language-markup">var foo = 42;    // foo is now a Number
var foo = 'bar'; // foo is now a String
var foo = true;  // foo is now a Boolean</code></pre>
</ol>

<p>In a weakly typed language, the type of a <strong>value depends on how it is used</strong>. For example, if I can pass a string to the addition operator and it will AutoMagically be interpreted as a number <strong>or cause an error if the contents of the string cannot be translated into a number</strong>. Similarly, I can concatenate strings and numbers or use strings as booleans, etc.</p>

<p>In a strongly typed language, <strong>a variable has a type and that type cannot change</strong>. What you can do to a variable depends on its type. If we try to compile the above code in TypeScript we will get the sfollowing error:</p>


<pre class="code-toolbar"><code class="language-typescript">[ts] Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type.
Variable 'foo' must be of type 'number', but here has type 'boolean'.
</code></pre>

<p>The advantage of a strongly typed language is that <strong>you are forced to make the behavior of your program explicit</strong>. If you want to add a number and a string your code, you must translate the string into a number to be used as an operand of the addition operator. <strong>This makes code easier to understand because there is no (or less) hidden behavior</strong>. This also makes your code more verbose.</p>


<blockquote class="blockquote bq-primary">
    <p class="bq-title">Remember:</p>
    <p><strong>Strong typing is optional in TypeScript but using this feature makes your application more predictable and make it easier to debug so you should definitely make use of it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Object-oriented</h4>

<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is an old concept used by multiple languages like Java or C# to help developer associate together data and methods within one "object". In <code>OOP</code> object are created and are able to interact with each other using one another's public facing methods. <strong>JavaScript itself is not an object-oriented language</strong> in the way that C++, C#, or Java are. <strong>TypeScript, on the other hand, can be treated as an object-oriented language</strong> because of the language constructs it introduces on top of JavaScript closures. </p>

<p>TypeScript brings many object-oriented features which we missed in JavaScript for a very long time. We have explicit concepts of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Classes</li>
  <li>Interfaces</li>
  <li>Constructors</li>
  <li>Access modifiers (public and private)</li>
</ul>

<p>We will learn all of that in the later sections.</p>


<h4>Compile-time error</h4>

<p>Let me explain first what <code>run-time error</code> is as this is a common case. We are talking about the <code>run-time error</code> when we face any issue while using our application. In other words â€” if you make a mistake when you create your website and write some code, you will see it only while using the application/website. For example, if you make a typo in an webpage file your browser console will show you an error when you load that page. </p>

<p>Due to weak typing in JavaScript, it often happens that we try to perform operations on a variable with a different type. If our application logic is complex we might not spot that we are trying to assign elements of a different type to each other. In JavaScript, we will get to know about the error <strong>only when someone triggers code and it fails</strong>. In contrast, TypeScript can provide us with compile-time errors, which means, it can spot errors while compiling code to JavaScript, and fix it before deploying to production. Of course it won't catch them all, but still a lot.</p>

<h4>Awesome tool-set</h4>

<p>I won't write much about this.  Along with this course you will see how many useful tools come with Angular.</p>
<p>Let's don't waste time and start coding!</p>





<!-- <p> Now imagine that you have to create 10 buttons on your page, and each button should trigger a different function. You want to assign each function, so we have:  </p>

<pre class="code-toolbar"><code class="language-markup">//HTML
&lt;button onclick=&quot;myFunction1()&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary waves-light&quot; mdbRippleRadius&gt;Button #1&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button onclick=&quot;myFunction2()&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary waves-light&quot; mdbRippleRadius&gt;Button #2&lt;/button&gt;
...
&lt;button onclick=&quot;myFunction10()&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary waves-light&quot; mdbRippleRadius&gt;Button #10&lt;/button&gt;

//JavaScript

function myFunction1(){
  console.log("I am function 1");
}
function myFunction2(){
  console.log("I am function 2");
}


... //and so on

</code></pre>

<p>When you click on <code>Button #1</code>, you will see a console log stating <code>I am function 1</code>, when you click on <code>Button #5</code>, you will see <code>I am function 5</code>.</p>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() ?>/content/angular/tutorials/angular/7/img/02.png" alt="Console log">


<p>Now imagine that you have made a typo in last function and named it <code>myFunction_10</code>, instead of <code>myFunction10</code> (note: extra <code>_</code>). When you open open a page, there won't be any error in a console. When you click on <code>Button #1</code> it will work fine, however when you click on <code>Button #10</code> you will get error in a console. </p>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() ?>/content/angular/tutorials/angular/7/img/03.png" alt="Console error">

<p>This is very dangerous, you can easily miss some obvious error and if your website lacks test, doesn't spot even after going to production , until one of the users tries to click Button #5. This is where compiler steps in to ease our life. When compiling our code to JavaScript, TypeScript compiler will spot </p>
