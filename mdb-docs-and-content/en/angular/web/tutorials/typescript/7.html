<!-- type assertion typescript 37,000 -->


<p>During application development, it may happen that you deal with a situation where you will know more about the value than TypeScript does. Most often in a situation, where you know that the type of a certain entity could be more specific than it is now.</p>

<p>Type assertion is a way to explicitly inform the compiler that you want to treat the entity as it would have a different type. This allows you to treat <code>any</code> as a <code>number</code>, or a <code>number</code> as a <code>string</code>. Let's have a look at the following example:</p>


<pre class="code-toolbar"><code class="language-typescript">let someValue: any = "I am sure I am a string";</code></pre>

<p>Although, we are sure that someValue contains a string, for the compiler it still has a type of <code>any</code>. As result, you won't be able to use methods like <code>length()</code> which is a default method for a string type variable. What you can do is to inform the compiler to treat it as a <code>string</code>. You can do this in two ways:</p>

<pre class="code-toolbar"><code class="language-typescript">let strLength: number = (<string>someValue).length;</code></pre>

<p>Or using the <code>as</code> syntax: </p>

<pre class="code-toolbar"><code class="language-typescript">let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;</code></pre>
