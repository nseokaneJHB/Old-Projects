      <strong>Running the application in a browser</strong>
    </h2>

    <p class="description">If you now run the application with the <code>ng serve </code>command, Service Workers would
      not work
      because the browser is not able to handle them. In order to test how the PWA application works, we need to
      install the <code>http-server</code> package from the npm repository. Thanks to it we will be able to run our
      application on
      the server, and check if everything works.</p>

    <p class="description">To do this, execute the following command in the terminal:</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
          <code class="language-javascript">npm install http-server -g</code>
        </pre>

    <p class="description">In order for a PWA application to be fully functional, its production version must be
      launched on the server. To do this, open the file <code>angular.json</code>, and modify the line <code>"outputPath":
        "dist/project-name",</code>.</p>
    <p class="description">Remove <code>/project-name</code> part so that only <code>"outputPath"</code> and "dist" are
      left. The <code>"outputPath"</code> line should therefore look like this:</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
          <code class="language-javascript">
              "outputPath": "dist",
          </code>
        </pre>

    <p class="description">Then open the package.json file, and add the following script to the scripts object, which
      will remove the already existing dist directory, generate a new one, and the launch the http-server package.</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
            <code class="language-javascript">
                "pwa": "ng build --prod && cd dist && http-server -p 8080 && cd .."
            </code>
          </pre>

    <p class="description">After adding the above script there is nothing left for us to do but to run our PWA
      application!
      To do this, enter the following commands in the terminal:</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
            <code class="language-javascript">
              npm run pwa
            </code>
          </pre>

    <p class="description">After running the <code>npm run pwa</code> command, just open the browser at <code>localhost:8080</code>,
      and enjoy the PWA application!</p>

    <p>In order to observe the effects of any changes, close the <code>http-server</code> with the
      combination of
      <code>CTRL + C</code> in the terminal, change something in your application - just add or remove one letter from
      the template,
      then save the file <code>app.component.html</code>, and execute command npm run pwa one more time.</p>
    <p>Remember that during this
      time you cannot close the browser window in which you have started the application. After running http-server one
      more time, refresh your browser tab, in which the <code>localhost:8080</code> address was opened.</p>

    <p class="description">After a few seconds you should see the modal, that tells us that a new version of the
      application has been
      detected, and asks whether you want to update it. If you press the Update! button, the website should be
      reloaded.</p>
