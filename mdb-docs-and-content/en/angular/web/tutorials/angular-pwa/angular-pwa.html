    <!--Description-->
    <p class="description">Today you will learn how to create your first Progressive Web App based on Angular 6 and MDB
      Angular!</p>
    <p class="description">
      Progressive Web Apps combine the convenience and functionality of native mobile applications with the simplicity
      of creating and managing web applications. Progressive Web App or PWA for short is simply a web app
      that behaves like a normal web app on a desktop and like a native app on mobile devices. So you can use it with
      Push Notifications, without an Internet connection, and much more!

      <strong>Adding the @angular/pwa mechanism to your existing application</strong>
    </h2>

    <p class="description">In Angular 6 we gained a very convenient option, thanks to which we can use one command to
      configure the PWA mechanism in our application. Thanks to that we save ourselves the effort of modifying
      individual project files.
      In order to add PWA to your application, type the following command in the terminal:</p>
    <pre class="code-toolbar">
        <code class="language-javascript">
            ng add @angular/pwa
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="description">After performing the above command, some new files have been created in our project and some
      existing ones have been modified.</p>
    <p><strong>New files:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>ngsw-config.json</code> - this contains the Service Workers configuration, thanks to which it is
        possible to cache
        application data in PWA;</li>
      <li><code>manifest.json</code> - in this file you will find the configuration of application's appearance. Here
        you
        can also change the name of the application, change the background and theme color;</li>
      <li>The <code>assets</code> directory has been expanded with icons for different resolutions, so that each type
        of device gets
        a customized icon for it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Modified files</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>app.module.ts</code> - the ServiceWorkerModule module has been added to the main module of our
        application. This allows us to use various functions provided by Service Workers;</li>
      <li><code>angular.json</code> - several options for configuration and operation of PWA have been added to the
        file;</li>
      <li><code>package.json</code> - a new @angular/wa package has been added, which we added in the previous step;</li>
      <li><code>index.html</code> - a link to the manifest.json file was added as well as the theme color - the same as
        defined in
        the manifest.json file.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--Title-->
    <h2 class="title mb-4">
      <strong>What Service Workers are?</strong>
    </h2>

    <p><strong>Service Workers</strong> is a JavaScript script that does not have direct access to the DOM tree. It is
      run independently
      of the website and allows you to use features that do not require interaction with the user or the website. As of
      today, this is, among other things, the Push Notification and background synchronization.
    </p>
    <p>In the future it will
      also be geofencing and periodical synchronization. Service Workers are very interesting because they also support
      offline mechanisms, thanks to which the programmer has complete control over the functionality of the
      application.
    </p>
    <p>Service Workers switch off when not used to free resources, and start up automatically when needed. If you need
      to use some data that will always be the same, use the IndexedDB API.</p>

    <h2 class="title mb-4">
      <strong>Creating the application view</strong>
    </h2>

    <p class="description">
      What is an application without a view? Nothing! After all, users must click on something, read something, and the
      data must be displayed somewhere. For this purpose we will prepare a very simple application layout. We will use
      the navigation bar, a footer, two buttons, a modal and some text.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      Let's start with the navigation bar. Open <code>app.component.html</code>, and paste in the code below, which is
      responsible for
      rendering the navigation bar.
    </p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="html" data-name="HTML">
        <!--Navbar-->
        <mdb-navbar SideClass="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark blue">
          <mdb-navbar-brand class="mx-auto">
            <a class="logo navbar-brand white-text"><strong>MDB Angular Sample PWA</strong></a>
          </mdb-navbar-brand>
        </mdb-navbar>
        <!--/.Navbar-->
      </code>
    </mdbsnippet>

    <p class="description">
      Once we have the navigation bar, it is time to take care of the footer. Paste the following code right after the
      end
      of the navigation bar in the <code></code>app.component.html file
    </p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="html" data-name="HTML">
        <footer class="footer-copyright fixed-bottom blue py-3 text-center text-white">
          © 2020 Copyright:
          <a class="text-white" href="https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/angular/"> MDBootstrap.com </a>
        </footer>
      </code>
    </mdbsnippet>

    <p class="description">
      If you refresh the page at this point, you will see that our application is slowly taking shape - great! It's
      now time to add the last piece of code to our template, which will present the final application. To do this,
      copy the code
      below between the navigation bar and the footer.

      <strong>Building the application logic</strong>
    </h2>

    <p class="description">
      Finally, the time has come for us to take up something more interesting. It's high time that we complement our
      template with the logic that is needed for our PWA to work.
      To do this, copy the following code to the <code>app.component.ts</code> file.
    </p>

    <mdbsnippet>
      <code data-lang="js" data-name="TS">
        import { SwUpdate } from '@angular/service-worker';
        import { Component, ViewChild, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
        import { ModalDirective } from 'angular-bootstrap-md';

        @Component({
          selector: 'app-root',
          templateUrl: './app.component.html',
          styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss']
        })
        export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
          @ViewChild('basicModal') basicModal: ModalDirective;

          constructor(private swUpdate: SwUpdate) { }

          ngOnInit() {
            this.checkForUpdates();
          }

          forceUpdate() {
            this.swUpdate.activateUpdate().then(() => {
              document.location.reload();
            });
          }

        checkForUpdates() {
          if (this.swUpdate.isEnabled) {
            this.swUpdate.available.subscribe(() => {
              console.log('New Version');
              this.basicModal.show();
              });
            }
          }
        }
      </code>
    </mdbsnippet>

    <p class="description">
      We inject the <code>SwUpdate</code> service into the constructor, which is a Service Worker used for working with
      application
      updates.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      During the <code>ngOnInit</code> lifecycle the <code>checkForUpdates()</code> method is called, whose task is to
      check if a new version of
      the PWA application is available.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      If available, the <code>show()</code> method from the <code>ModalDirective</code> directive is called, which is
      responsible for displaying
      the modal with information that a new version of the application is available.
      <br>
      There are two buttons in this modal. One of them is responsible for calling the <code>forceUpdate()</code>
      method, which
      reloads the application. The second button closes the modal without updating the application.
    </p>

    <p class="description">It's very simple - isn't it? Service Worker checks if there is a new version based on
      the application size. If there is one, the user can either reload the application or work with an older version
      of the application.</p>

  <section id="browser">


    <!--Title-->
    <h2 class="title mb-4">
      <strong>Running the application in a browser</strong>
    </h2>

    <p class="description">If you now run the application with the <code>ng serve </code>command, Service Workers would
      not work
      because the browser is not able to handle them. In order to test how the PWA application works, we need to
      install the <code>http-server</code> package from the npm repository. Thanks to it we will be able to run our
      application on
      the server, and check if everything works.</p>

    <p class="description">To do this, execute the following command in the terminal:</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
      <code class="language-javascript">npm install http-server -g</code>
    </pre>

    <p class="description">In order for a PWA application to be fully functional, its production version must be
      launched on the server. To do this, open the file <code>angular.json</code>, and modify the line <code>"outputPath":
        "dist/project-name",</code>.</p>
    <p class="description">Remove <code>/project-name</code> part so that only <code>"outputPath"</code> and "dist" are
      left. The <code>"outputPath"</code> line should therefore look like this:</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
      <code class="language-javascript">
          "outputPath": "dist",
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="description">Then open the package.json file, and add the following script to the scripts object, which
      will remove the already existing dist directory, generate a new one, and the launch the http-server package.</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
        <code class="language-javascript">
            "pwa": "rm -rf dist && ng build --prod && cd dist && http-server -p 8080 && cd .."
        </code>
      </pre>

    <p class="description">After adding the above script there is nothing left for us to do but to run our PWA application!
      To do this, enter the following commands in the terminal:</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
        <code class="language-javascript">
          npm run pwa
        </code>
      </pre>

    <p class="description">After running the <code>npm run pwa</code> command, just open the browser at <code>localhost:8080</code>,
      and enjoy the PWA application!</p>

    <p>In order to observe the effects of any changes, close the <code>http-server</code> with the
      combination of
      <code>CTRL + C</code> in the terminal, change something in your application - just add or remove one letter from
      the template,
      then save the file <code>app.component.html</code>, and execute command npm run pwa one more time.</p>
    <p>Remember that during this
      time you cannot close the browser window in which you have started the application. After running http-server one
      more time, refresh your browser tab, in which the <code>localhost:8080</code> address was opened.</p>

    <p class="description">After a few seconds you should see the modal, that tells us that a new version of the application has been
      detected, and asks whether you want to update it. If you press the Update! button, the website should be reloaded.</p>

    <h2 class="title mb-4">
      <strong>Deploying the application on Firebase</strong>
    </h2>

    <p class="description">The PWA application will only work on a server that is encrypted (HTTPS protocol). The
      quickest way to run a PWA application on a domain that is HTTPS-certified is to deploy applications in Firebase
      Hosting. In order to create a Firebase account, open <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/" target="blank">this
        page</a>.</p>

    <p class="description">After logging in to the Firebase service, you need to create a new application, which will
      be our PWA application. To do this, click the "Add Project" button and go through the short form in which you
      will provide the name of your project and some other required information.</p>

    <p class="description">After creating a new Firebase application, return to your PWA application terminal,
      and install the firebase-tools utility by running the following command in it.</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
        <code class="language-javascript">
          npm install -g firebase-tools
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="description">After installing firebase-tools we will have no choice but to then sign in to the Firebase
      service using the login and password of the Google account, initiate a new Firebase project, and deploy it in the
      Firebase Hosting service. To do this, type in the command <code>firebase login</code> in your terminal.</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
        <code class="language-javascript">
          firebase login
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="description">After logging in to Firebase, type in the command <code>firebase init hosting</code> to
      initialize the
      project, which will be deposited in Firebase Hosting. Then, from the menu that will appear to you in the terminal,
      select the Firebase application created two steps above. Then the console will ask you a few questions - answer
      them according to the diagram below:</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
        <code class="language-javascript">
          firebase init hosting
        </code>
    </pre>
    <ul>
      <li>What do you want to use as your public directory? - <strong>dist</strong></li>
      <li>Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? - <strong>y</strong></li>
      <li>File dist/index.html already exists. Overwrite? - <strong>n</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="description">After initializing the application we have nothing else left to do but to send it to
      the Firebase servers. But first we have to build a production version of our application!
      <br> To do this, run the command below in the terminal of your application.</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
        <code class="language-javascript">
          npm run pwa
        </code>
      </pre>

    <p class="description">The last step after initiating the Firebase application is to deploy it in the Firebase Hosting
      service. To do this, type in the command below in the terminal of your PWA application,
      and open the
      browser at the address, that will display the terminal after the deployment process is finished.</p>

    <pre class="code-toolbar">
        <code class="language-javascript">
          firebase deploy
        </code>
      </pre>

    <p class="description">And that's it! Your first PWA application is already on the Firebase servers, so you can pick up
      your mobile phone and open your favorite web browser at the address of the application. When you add it to your
      smartphone's home screen, you can launch it at any time - even without an active Internet connection via the
      icon. Isn't this a great option?</p>

    <p class="description">
      In this tutorial I wanted to show what a Progressive Web Application really is. The topic is so broad that it
      cannot be described in one article. The application itself - its functionality and appearance may not impress,
      but in my opinion, it is a good example for the very beginning of your adventure with PWA. Thanks to that you have
      at least a basic knowledge of how to build a PWA application and what it is related to.
