<h2>1. App goals and overview</h2>

<p>Now when we know the basic concept behind how Angular works let's build a real App! I am going to show you the final result first and then quickly analyze it. After that, <strong>I will show you how to build this app from scratch</strong>. 
</p>


<p>So, let's don't waste more time and start working. </p>


<h2>2. Run the app </h2>

<p>Within the tutorial files you will find a final application code, let's use it to run our app:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open a terminal</li>
  <li>Navigate to the <code>agenda-app/final/</code> folder</li>
  <li>Install the dependencies using <code>npm install</code></li>
  <li>Run the app using <code>npm start</code></li>
  <li>See the results in a browser:</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Voila! Our app is running</strong>.</p>
<h2>3. Test the app</h2>

<p>The application which we are about to build is a <strong>daily agenda app</strong>. It allows us to display a list of events planned for today including time, title, location and description. We can add new Events as well as remove existing ones. The app also displays a weather forecast. </p>

<p>Now <strong>take some time to play with the app</strong>. Note that whenever you are adding/removing events, <strong>the counter in the right column is changing</strong>.</p>

<h2>4. Responsiveness</h2>

<p>Our application is also <strong>responsive by default</strong>. Just change the size of the browser to see how it displays on different screen size:
