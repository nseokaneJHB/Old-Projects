    <strong>Adding the @angular/pwa mechanism to your existing application</strong>
  </h2>

  <p class="description">
    Without adding the PWA mechanism, your application will not work offline. To find out about it, open the <code>localhost:4200</code>
    address in a Google Chrome browser, open the
    developer tools using the F12 key, then open the Network tab, and select the Offline checkbox and refresh
    the page. You will find out that the application cannot work without an Internet connection.
  </p>

  <p class="description">Do you think about what it's all about? After all, it was supposed to work offline and not -
    calmly! You will immediately learn how to make your application work offline.</p>

  <p class="description">In Angular 6 we gained a very convenient option, thanks to which we can use one command to
    configure the PWA mechanism in our application. Thanks to that, we can save ourselves the effort of modifying
    individual project files.
    In order to add PWA to your application, type the following command in the terminal:</p>
  <pre class="code-toolbar">
          <code class="language-javascript">
              ng add @angular/pwa
          </code>
      </pre>

  <p class="description">After performing the above command, some new files have been created in our project and some
    existing ones have been modified.</p>
  <p><strong>New files:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>ngsw-config.json</code> — this contains the Service Workers configuration, thanks to which it is
      possible to cache
      application data in PWA;
    </li>
    <li><code>manifest.json</code> — in this file you will find the configuration of the application's appearance. Here
      you
      can also change the name of the application, change the background and theme color;
    </li>
    <li>The <code>assets</code> directory has been expanded with icons for different resolutions so that each type
      of device gets
      a customized icon for it.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Modified files</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>app.module.ts</code> — the ServiceWorkerModule module has been added to the main module of our
      application. This allows us to use various functions provided by Service Workers;
    </li>
    <li><code>angular.json</code> — several options for the configuration and operation of PWA have been added to this
      file;
    </li>
    <li><code>package.json</code> — a new @angular/pwa package has been added, which we added in the previous step;</li>
    <li><code>index.html</code> — a link to the manifest.json file was added as well as the theme color — the same color as
      defined in
      the manifest.json file.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the picture below, the files that have been created are marked in red and those that have been modified with the
    <code>ng add @angular/pwa</code> command in green.</p>

    <strong>What Service Workers are?</strong>
  </h2>

  <p><strong>Service Workers</strong> is a JavaScript script that does not have direct access to the DOM tree. It is
    run independently
    of the website and allows you to use features that do not require interaction with the user or the website. As of
    today, this are, among other things, push notifications and background synchronization.
  </p>
  <p>In the future, it will
    also include geofencing and periodical synchronization. Service Workers are very interesting because they also
    support
    offline mechanisms, thanks to which the programmer has complete control over the functionality of the
    application.
  </p>
  <p>Service Workers switch off when not used to free up resources, and start-up automatically when needed. If you need
    to use some data that will always be the same, use the IndexedDB API.</p>
